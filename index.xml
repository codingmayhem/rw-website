      <title>R&#39;s Vulnerable Store (Web App)</title>

      <description>The fake store has been built on the latest front end technologies and runs on PHP 8.0 - Just because it looks modern doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s secure. It features search, a cart and an account area. Cross site scripting attacks can be ran on all of the site including in input boxes and via URLs too.
The account section is located in the cart page, the store doesnâ€™t use a database but customer accounts are kept in another way.</description>

      <description>In this lab we will setup EIGRP.
EIGRP is a routing protocol used on Cisco routers
This lab can be done on Packet Tracer, GNS3, CML, etc
For info on how to run this lab visit &amp;ldquo;Running Labs&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;Show more&amp;rdquo; at the top of our website We will start with a topology of 3 routers, any Cisco IOS router will work for this.
Our topology looks like this as a base:</description>

      <title>Bulk Domain Lookups In Powershell</title>
      <link>https://ramons.work/posts/powershell-bulk-dns-lookups/</link>

      <description>Here we have a powershell script / command to bulk lookup the MX/NS/A/CNAME records of domains from a .txt file full of domains.
This comes in very useful when you need to bulk check a bunch of domains, for example to find out which domains are still pointing to an old nameserver.
We want to open powershell up in Admin mode (the script does nothing that needs admin but I found it to sometimes crash or stutter in non admin mode)</description>

      <title>Fix Screen Tearing In XFCE On AMD GPUs</title>
      <link>https://ramons.work/posts/amd-xfce-tearing/</link>

      <description>Screen tearing is still a common issue on Linux, more so on the XFCE desktop environment. Resolving it is fairly straight forward however can be hard to find the correct solution online as many tutorials tell you to do stuff like disable the composer which doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be done.
Screen tearing can be fixed with this one simple command
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/vblank_mode -t string -s &amp;quot;glx&amp;quot; --create And then reboot.</description>
