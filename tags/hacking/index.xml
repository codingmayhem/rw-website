      <description>The fake store has been built on the latest front end technologies and runs on PHP 8.0 - Just because it looks modern doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s secure. It features search, a cart and an account area. Cross site scripting attacks can be ran on all of the site including in input boxes and via URLs too.
The account section is located in the cart page, the store doesnâ€™t use a database but customer accounts are kept in another way.</description>
